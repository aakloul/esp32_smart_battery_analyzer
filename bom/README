## WARNING
- IRL540 has been discontinued and is no longer found in the market
- PCBWay will propose a replacement with IRFZ44NPBF, but DO NOT ACCEPT as it won't work: Swapping an IRL540 for an IRFZ44N in a low-voltage gate drive circuit results in the latter to not turn on, causing no or limited current being drawn

## Alternatives

For direct use with 3.3V/5V microcontrollers (like Arduino), the IRLZ44N (logic-level) is a better, more efficient choice than the standard IRFZ44N. The primary difference is that the IRLZ44N is a logic-level MOSFET, meaning it can be fully controlled by low-voltage logic (like a 3.3V or 5V microcontroller I/O pin, e.g esp32 chip), while the IRFZ44N is a standard-level MOSFET that requires a higher gate voltage (typically 10V) for full turn-on.
